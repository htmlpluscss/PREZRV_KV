					NFTs as Immutable Records
				</h3>

				<p>
					We authenticate ecological initiatives by&nbsp;tokenizing applicable data into an NFT called a Tokenized Ecological Initiative (TEI), backed by the appreciable value of&nbsp;an initiative. These TEIs are never sold, and act as a public ledger of our work.

					Asset-Based Collectibles
				</h3>

				<p>
					We then issue tradable NFTs that are based on the valuation of the original TEI&nbsp;(NFTEIs) and the natural assets they protect. This allows users to purchase exclusive, tangible collectibles which enable us to fund our ecological mission.

					NFTEI use-cases go beyond fundraising. Features include metaverse and game add-ons, AR/VR functionality, evolving imagery, and more. They also enable the&nbsp;resale of this proof of support - and&nbsp;further fundraising through royalties.
